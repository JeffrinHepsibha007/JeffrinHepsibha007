- 👋 Hi, I’m @JeffrinHepsibha007  
- 👀 I’m interested in building user-friendly web apps, solving algorithmic challenges, and experimenting with creative tech ideas.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack Java development, OS concepts, DBMS, and brushing up on DSA (yes, again 😅).  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, academic CS problems, and anything that mixes code with creativity.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [jeffrinhepsibha007@gmail.com](mailto:jeffrinhepsibha007@gmail.com) or DM me on LinkedIn!  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can debug Java code, roast people with love, study 5 units in a day (after scrolling reels), and still have energy to vibe with my guitar 🎸✨
